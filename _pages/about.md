Hi my name is Sang. I am a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Although I have many research interests, I've recently been working in the field of Software Testing on the Penrose team with Dr. Joshua Sunshine, Dr. Brad Myers and Matt Davis.
